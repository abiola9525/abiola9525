# Hi, I'm Omotoso Abdul-Rauf Abiola(ORADEV) 👋

I'm a **Backend Engineer and Data Scientist** with professional experience building scalable backend systems and developing data-driven solutions using machine learning.  
Most of my production work has been done in **private repositories** for startups and client projects, but I maintain public showcases and detailed summaries to demonstrate my technical depth, problem-solving approach, and engineering practices.
